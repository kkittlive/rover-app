# Mars Rover

Code challenge completed by Janette Kwan

## Summary

* Specify the dimensions of a plateau on Mars
* Drop as many rovers as you'd like onto this plateau
* Specify each rover's starting location and orientation, and specify each rover's route
* The resulting position of all your rovers will be returned

## Usage

* Run `git clone https://github.com/kkittlive/rover-app.git` to download this repo to your local environment
* Run `cd rover-app` to be sure you're in this proper directory
* Run `gem install bundler && bundle install` to install dependcies
* Run `ruby app.rb` to execute the app
* Run `bundle exec rspec` to execute the tests
